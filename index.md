<p class="lead">If You followed part 1 of Reactjs bootcamp properly and my fellow mentor did a good job(I know he does), you should have a good understanding of React Components, states, props etc. If you do, you are good to go.</p>

<p class="lead"> For the sake of ease we we'll be sticking with <a href="http://codenvy.io/dashboard/">codenvy</a> for React Native App Development as well. Firebase would be our backend as before, but since we are developing mobile apps and not web apps that too on a cloud workspace it ain't gonna be easy. So put your persistence boots on and get ready to create your first React Native Mobile App.</p>
