## _Creating the App_  
Wait what?? "Creating the App" what were we doing until now?ðŸ¤”   
Haha, By Creating the App I mean Generating the APK file, So that you can share your App with your friends and tell them how cool App developer ninja you are. So, Let's get started.   

* First thing first, to be able to install the generated APK you must first sign it with a key. what's a `sign` and what's a `key`. In short a key is a file with all of your details ,which works as certificate that you can trust this app.   so let's create a keystore with keytool that comes with Java. Run the below command from the android directory  
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`  
This command creates a keystore with the name `my-release-key.keystore` alias `my-key-alias`. you should change these two to your preferred names. just remember those two, we'll need them later. After you run this command it will prompt you for some of your details, just fill them in and also remember the password to your keystore.
* Now edit the file `gradle.properties` in android directory, and add following lines  
```
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
```  
change the details accordingly  

* Now change your `android/app/build.gradle` as follows
```
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig { ... }
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```  

* Now from `android` directory run  
`./gradlew assembleRelease`  
With that you should have you apps APK file in `android/app/app-release.apk`  
Download this file and install it in your phone, now you have your app running on your own mobile. Give yourself a pat on your shoulder. Coz now you've successfully created your own React Native App.
